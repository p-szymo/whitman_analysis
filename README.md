# *Leaves of Grass* Analysis
## NLP analysis of Walt Whitman's seminal work

Using Project Gutenberg's [Leaves of Grass](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1322), I perform data analysis of Walt Whitman's poetry. 

## Future steps

I'm currently in the early stages. So far I have created a corpus of the work using Pandas, from which I can use various NLP techniques to analyze line length, syllabic structure, rhyme schemes, and frequently used words.

In a larger context, I plan to eventually compare this work to the work of Whitman's contemporaries. More specifically, I would like to compare and contrast Whitman with British (and possibly French) poetries.
